Hello! I am an incoming Postdoctoral Scholar in the Berkeley School of Education, working with [Dr. Dana Miller-Cotto](https://www.danamillercotto.com/). I earned my Ph.D. in Human Development at University of Maryland, College Park, where I was advised by Dr. Richard Prather. In my research, I aim to understand how students engage cognitive skills when learning math and science. Specifically, I examine executive functioning and spatial/relational reasoning. The goal of this research is to inform efforts in improving math and science learning, as these foundational skills are important for later academic and career outcomes.
